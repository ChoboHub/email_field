# Email Field

* Version: 1.2
* Author: Symphony Team, originally by Alistair Kearney
* Build Date: 14th May 2012
* Requirements: Symphony 2.3

Works just like a normal Input field, but forces the contents to be a valid Email address and provides a hash value in the XML. This extension deprecated in favour of the [Output field](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/output_field/).

## Installation

1. Upload the `/email_field` folder to your Symphony `/extensions` folder.
2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Email", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.
3. You can now add the "Email" field to your sections.
